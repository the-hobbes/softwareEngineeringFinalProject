# This handler executes the actual game environment. The initial gameboard is setup and displayed as a response to an http GET
#	request. The GameHandler class fills the role of a 'Controller' in the MVC paradigm. It manages game logic and responds to
#	POST requests from the View (a collection of Javascript and HTML code). In addition to having a method to handle each state,
#	the GameHander class also possesses several utility functions (including setup, swapping translation, etc...).
